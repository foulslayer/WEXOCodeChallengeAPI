## Description

The front page showcases movies that you can scroll through horizontally. A button allows you to load more movies as you scroll. By clicking on a movie, you can view more details about it.

In the navbar, there's a "Genres" section. Clicking on a genre takes you to a page displaying only movies from that genre. Similar to the front page, you can scroll down and load more movies as you approach the bottom of the page.
